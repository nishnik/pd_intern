- [pubmed_fetch.py](pubmed_fetch.py) will fetch the data.
- [training_data_parse.py](training_data_parse.py) will parse it
- [finalise_data.py](finalise_data.py) is for the small things left.
- [dssm_imple.py](dssm_imple.py) is the original implementation
- [vec_and_dssm.py](vec_and_dssm.py) is CDSSM with pre-trained word vectors (Consider this as the final code)
- [kmax_vec_dssm.py](kmax_vec_dssm.py) is attempt to implement kmax (It doesnt give a good result)
- [lda.py](lda.py) is baseline implementation
